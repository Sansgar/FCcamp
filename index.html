                <div id="info">
                    <p>Arjen Anthony Lucassen (born 3 April 1960) is a Dutch singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist
                        musician
                        and record producer best known for his long-running progressive metal/rock opera project Ayreon.
                        Lucassen started his career in 1980 as the guitarist and backing vocalist of Dutch band Bodine
                        as Iron
                        Anthony, before joining Vengeance in 1984. After eight years he left the band, wanting to go
                        into a more
                        progressive direction, and released two years later an unsuccessful solo album entitled Pools of
                        Sorrow,
                        Waves of Joy under the nickname Anthony. </p>
                    <span></span>
                    <p>In 1995, Lucassen released an album uncredited to any artist called Ayreon: The Final Experiment,
                        in
                        which he sang, wrote every song and played most of the instruments. The album conducted to the
                        creation
                        of Ayreon; despite being relatively unknown at first, the project gained notable attention and
                        praise
                        with the release of its third album Into the Electric Castle, establishing Lucassen as a notable
                        composer of rock operas. Following Ayreon's success, Lucassen has been involved in many other
                        projects: he is the creator, composer and current guitarist/keyboardist of Star One, Guilt
                        Machine, and
                        The Gentle Storm, and the creator and former guitarist of Ambeon and Stream of Passion. He
                        composes and
                        writes most of his songs, but leaves the lyrics to his musical partners in some of his projects.
                    </p>
                    <span></span>
                    <p>Lucassen plays a wide variety of instruments: his main instruments are guitar and keyboards,
                        however he
                        also plays bass, banjo and many others. Overall, in his career and including all his bands and
                        projects
                        (as principal instrumentalist/creative force or as a member), Lucassen has released twenty-six
                        studio
                        albums, four live albums, two EPs and seventeen singles. He has also made many minor
                        participations
                        alongside various artists including Shadow Gallery, After Forever, Within Temptation and
                        Avantasia, and

                <div class="projects">
                    <div>
                        <h3>Ayreon</h3>
                        <p>AYREON was born two decades ago Arjen was suddenly and inexplicably overwhelmed by a
                            compulsion to create rock-operas. This was back in the 1990s, the era of grunge and
                            alternative rock, so the idea of releasing a rock opera was unthinkable to most sensible
                            people. Yet history has shown that Arjen's creative impulse was not only a personal triumph,
                            it spearheaded a whole new era of rock operas. Musically, Ayreon albums tend to be
                            characterized by extreme opposites: brutal guitars cut to
                            lighthearted mandolins, classic roaring Hammonds collide with screaming digital synths, and
                            dark death grunts battle angelic Celtic voices. The dramatic concepts range from fantasy
                            (Actual Fantasy) to science fiction (01011001) to the inner landscape of human emotion (The
                            Human Equation).</p>

                        <h3>Ambeon</h3>
                        <p>Ambeon is mysterious and ambient side project of Arjen Anthony Lucassen featuring Astrid van
                            der Veen, very talented young female vocalist.

                            Astrid was only 14 years old when Fate of a Dreamer was released. The single Cold Metal was
                            released with a few bonus tracks, and the song was also featured on a Dutch compilation
                            sampler for Gothic music called Into Temptation. Fate of a Dreamer was out of print for far
                            to long, but was re-released in an extended version in December 2011; and is now available
                            in Arjen's Webshop.</p>

                        <h3>Star One</h3>
                        <p>The first Star One album, Space Metal (2002) was Arjen's reaction to his previous project,
                            the relatively soft Ambeon.

                            After releasing the first few Ayreon albums, Arjen had noticed that many others were
                            following in his footsteps and releasing their own rock operas. Upon listening to these, his
                            impression was that “on some of these operas the singers sound the same, and so you need the
                            CD booklet to tell them apart.” To ensure that didn't happen on 'Space Metal', Arjen cast a
                            line-up of singers with distinct voices, singers whom listeners could easily tell apart
                            without the help of the CD booklet. Dan Swanö (ex-Edge of Sanity, Nightingale) was recruited
                            for the the low parts, Russell Allen (Symphony X) took care of the powerful, gritty parts,
                            Damian Wilson (ex-Threshold) sang the high clear parts, and to top it off, Floor Jansen
                            (After Forever) belted out the really high choruses. Robert Soeterboek (Ayreon) took care of
                            the backing vocals with his huge smoky voice.</p>

                        <h3>Guilt Machine</h3>
                        <p>Arjen's unwillingness to bow to trends and outside expectations is once again apparent in his
                            latest release, On This Perfect Day, the first album from his new project Guilt Machine. On
                            this release, he departs from the over-the-top complexity of Ayreon in favor of the
                            simplicity of a relatively small line-up. Rather than an putting together an ensemble cast
                            of vocalists, Arjen recruited Jasper Steverlinck, singer of the Belgian alternative rock
                            band Arid, as the sole vocalist of Guilt Machine. The talents of Chris Maitland
                            (ex-Porcupine Tree) were enlisted for the drum parts. Arjen's partner and manager Lori
                            Linstruth supplied the guitar solos. The rest of the instruments were played by Arjen
                            himself, who also sings backing vocals.</p>

                        <h3>Stream of Passion</h3>
                        <p>After Dutch guitarist/composer/producer Arjen Anthony Lucassen had finished his latest
                            endeavour, the Ayreon rock opera The Human Equation (2004), he wanted to do two things:
                            showcase the many talents of Mexican singer Marcela Bovio, one of the vocalists on the
                            Ayreon album, and form a band for the first time in 10 years. Marcela first registered on
                            Arjen's radar before the recording of The Human Equation, when
                            she entered the contest run through his website in which the winner would get the
                            opportunity to sing on the album. “When I first heard Marcela's recordings, it sent shivers
                            down my spine. To find a vocalist who sings with that much passion and power, is rare, very
                            rare.” And Lucassen should know; in the past he's worked with over a hundred different
                            vocalists for his many musical projects.</p>
